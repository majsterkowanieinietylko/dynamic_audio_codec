# DAC - Dynamic Audio Codec

DAC is a lossy audio codec offering compression quality better than MP3, especially on lower bitrates. It doesn't introduce annoying harsh articats on high tones and compared to MP3, it's also much simpler. I demostrated DAC's performance in one of the videos of mine, feel free to check it out: https://youtu.be/Qy_AinciI9Y
